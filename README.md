Statistically, it then becomes a problem how people decide whether to accept or not a large batch of prepackaged product, where a batch usually contains incredibly many unit products that itâ€™s impossible to check them one-by-one. On top of that, Chinese government develop a system of rules of metrological
testing for net quantities of products, which the project is interested in.

The project is based on Rules of metrological testing for net quantities of products in prepackages with fixed content, issued by Chinese government in 2005.
